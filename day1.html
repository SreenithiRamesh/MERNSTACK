        <h1>Artificial intelligence</h1>
        <h2>ZeroGPT</h2>
        <p>ZeroGPT is a software tool that supposedly determines whether a text was created 
            using an AI program like ChatGPT. It is based in Hamburg, Germany. ZeroGPT claims 
            to determine whether the written text was produced by a human , an AI system, such 
            as ChatGPT[3][4]</p>
        <h2>ChatGPT</h2>
        <p>ChatGPT has been accused of engaging in biased or discriminatory behaviors, such as telling jokes about men and people from England while refusing to tell jokes about women and people from India,[120] or praising figures such as Joe Biden while
         refusing to do the same for Donald Trump.[121][122]Conservative 
         commentators accused ChatGPT of bias toward left-leaning perspectives.[123][124][125] Additionally, an August 2023 paper found a "significant and systematic political bias toward the Democrats in the US, Lula in Brazil, and the Labour Party in the UK."[126] In response to such criticism,
         OpenAI acknowledged plans to allow ChatGPT to create "outputs that other people (ourselves included) may strongly disagree with".  </p>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
     <p>The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers 
expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a]</p>
        <h3>Learning</h3>
 <p>Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[39] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]There are  several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data 
 and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[42] Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric
  function based on numeric input).[43] In reinforcement learning the agent is  rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good".[44] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[45] 
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.[46] </p>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <span><strong>AIand machine learning technology</strong>is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s,including:
            <ol>
                <li>search engines (such as <strong>Google Search</strong>)</li>
                <li>targeting online advertisements</li>
                <li>recommendation systems (offered by <strong> YouTube or Amazon</strong>)</li>
                <li>driving internet traffic</li>
                 <li>targeted advertising (<strong>AdSense, Facebook</strong>)</li>
                 <li>virtual assistants (such as <strong>Alexa or siri</strong>)</li> 
                 <li>autonomous vehicles (including <strong>drones,ADAS and self-driving cars</strong>)</li>
                 <li>automatic language translation (<strong>Microsoft Translator, Google Translate</strong>)</li>
                  <li>facial recognition (<strong>Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet</strong>)</li>
                </ol> 
        </span>
        <h3>Risks and harm</h3> <span>  Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about<strong> privacy, surveillance and copyright</strong>.
